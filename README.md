> **SMXstamina** is a modlet for 7 Days to Die A17.

SMXmSta is a StaminaLoss modifier that lets you change the values for StaminaLoss from using tools and weapons as well as physical exertion like jumping and swimming. You can make changes in the xml file by editing the values, the default setting for SMXmSta is 50% reduction.

This modlet will cut the stamina use when using tools and melee weapons by half. It was made for those out there that find themselves constantly running out of stamina and feel that the current stamina balance in the game keeps them from having fun.

> **This modlet will affect the game balance and the _gameplay experience_ will as such not be as the developer intended.**
